# Teaching English as a Second Language

Resources, tips, and guides for teaching ESL. 
## Curricula
* []

## Activities
* Weekly Poem Sharing. Provide a few resources for students to select a poem from, or ask them to search online; students prepare to present the poem to the class, with their thoughts on its meaning. 
  * Good for adult learners.
* Discussion games https://owlcation.com/academia/10-Fun-ESL-Activities-to-Practice-Modal-Auxiliary-Verbs
  * Be sure to break the ice properly, as the activities rely heavily on improvised speaking
* Improv Comedy Games (found on  Youtube). Expert Village on Youtube has some good videos. 
  * Get students up and running; incorporating movement shifts attention away from the awkwardness of speaking illogically/imperfectly.
  * Keep things simple but clear; create specific situations for students to improvise (e.g. giving/receiving a present), rather than leaving too much to creativity.
* Song analysis. This was a flop for me. 
  * Pick a popular/famous song, not an easy song
* Group Language exchange (equal numbers native/non-native speakers). 
  * Split the time between group ice breakers, and 1-1 conversation. 
  * Competitive games (relays, quick draw) are more effective than games that require too much thinking (e.g. 2 truths+lie). 
  * Provide conversation topic guides/games.
