# Korean Language Resources



## Curricula 
* Sogang Korean Language series (Textbooks). Builds foundations on speaking (dialogue) and everyday Korean, before more formal grammar.
* Intermediate College Korean (Web-based Textbook with audio) (PDF). http://www.language.berkeley.edu/korean/10/index.htm 
Good for traditional, structured, and challenging material for intermediate learners. 
* Cyber University of Korea (Video Lecture series; also on Youtube) (CUK) http://korean.cuk.edu/en/courses 
Great for more audio-visual learning, at a pace that helps beginners get comfortable with more complex sentence structures commonly used in daily conversation.
* Talk to me in Korean (Video series; also on Youtube) TTMIK https://talktomeinkorean.com/curriculum;level=;theme=Free 
I haven't used this much; they're more geared for self-learners, and the sheer volume of content available would get anyone to a basic understanding of the language.

## Supplementary Resources

* How to study korean (Website) http://www.howtostudykorean.com/ 
Thorough descriptions and explanations of grammar and vocabulary, catered to native English speakers.
* HiNative (Mobile App/Website) https://hinative.com/
Forum-like platform to ask/answer language questions. Many users from Korea and China, and responses usually come within minutes. Good for clarifying simple questions.
* Pronunciation videos from Motivate Korean (Youtube Channel) https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBpRNdkIp4LSUCgXOcp1NSQ 
One of the better and more accurate explanations by a non-native speaker, for non-native speakers.


## "Input" sources
I.e. ways to practice listening, reading, writing.
* Naver Webtoons (Mobile App) https://comic.naver.com
Less-stressful reading practice, very easy way to increase vocabulary. Also good for learning slang! 
* 시요일 (Mobile App) https://www.siyoil.com/
App that sends Korean poems every day. 
* 씀 (Mobile App) http://www.ssm10b.com/ 
App that sends writing prompts every day with related excerpts from Korean literature. Users upload their writing to share too, so it gives great exposure to all sorts of writing styles (good and bad..).
* Radio talk shows, easily found on Youtube. I find these more effective than TV shows (no subs, more expressive speech, less talking over each other).
* Follow artists, writers, celebrities, etc on instagram.
* Follow businesses and pages on Facebook
